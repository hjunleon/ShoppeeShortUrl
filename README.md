Thanks for the workshop, really learnt quite alot about real world systems since I'm just year 1! 
If any of you have the time, could you explain how to make the snowflake one work? I have no idea where to put the multiprocessing code nor know if I should run more docker containers(if this is so, also no idea how to link it up)

Anyways hopefully we could connect over linkedIn to discuss further and also make friends! :D
